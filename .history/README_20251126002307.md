3. Frontend Setup (AssetFrontend)


Open AssetFrontend in VS Code.


Make sure the .env file exists with the API URL above.


Install dependencies:


npm install



Run the frontend:


npm run dev



Open your browser at:


http://localhost:5173


Running the Project


Start backend first (AssetAPI)


Then start frontend (AssetFrontend)


The frontend will automatically use the backend API URL from .env



Environment Variables


.env is used to store local settings and should not be pushed to GitHub.


Example .env:


VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5011



Backend: appsettings.Development.json contains local DB connection string:


{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=AssetDB;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}


Notes


.env and appsettings.Development.json are ignored by Git to protect sensitive info.


Backend runs on port 5011, frontend on 5173 (default). Make sure these ports are free.


Other developers need to create their own .env and configure their local DB.



Troubleshooting


If frontend cannot reach the API → check VITE_API_BASE_URL in .env.


If backend cannot connect to DB → verify your local SQL Server instance and DB name.


Node modules missing → run npm install in AssetFrontend.

This README now includes everything a teammate would need to **clone, set up, run, and test** the project locally.  

---

If you want, I can also **add a short “Test API Request” section** so teammates can quickly verify the backend API works with Axios.  

Do you want me to add that?
